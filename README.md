# dga_anomaly
Four anomaly detection methods are explored with bagging and stacking ensembling to see if performing anomaly detection helps improve the classification of domains, especially adversarially generated domains. This uses data containing benign and AGD domains obtained from the DMD2018 dataset [1], and adversarial domain data obtained from https://github.com/liorsidi/Adversarial-DGA-Datasets [2][3].
